Hands-on Python Tutorial
========================

By Dr. Andrew N. Harrington
===========================

Home Page for Python 3
==========================

This page has materials for Python 3.1 and later, which is incompatible
in various ways with earlier versions. If you are using Python 2.5, 2.6, or
2.7, go to the older compatible version `here <../index26.html>`_. 

The Hands-on Python Tutorial formats:

-  `Browse web page sections online <handsonHtml/index.html>`_ 
-  `Zip file <handsonHtml.zip>`_ for optional download of all web pages. 
   The web page to open
   after expanding the zip file is handsonHtml/index.html.  
   This form is useful if you are going to be offline while reading.
-  `PDF file <Hands-onPythonTutorial.pdf>`_ in paged format for **printing**.
   Some people even prefer this version while on a computer with a wide enough
   window.  The pdf uses different fonts and layout than the web version.

Example programs **needed to test out code used in the tutorial**:

-  `Examples zip file <examples.zip>`_  for download.  
   **Be sure to download this file and then expand it** to have
   all the Python example programs needed for the tutorial. 


The tutorial continues to be updated and expanded. You can see an
outline of the latest major changes in the `change
log <changelog.html>`_.

Feedback Appreciated From All
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I get feedback from my introductory class, but not so much from other
people. I am looking to make this tutorial work for as wide a group as
possible. I would really appreciate the questions and comments of
others, too, so I can improve it as much as possible. Do not be shy!

Thanks. If you have suggestions for me, please let me know if I may
mention you in the `change log <changelog.html>`_ in case I make changes
suggested by you.
