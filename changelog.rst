August 31, 2009

-  Tuple introduction moved consistently to the Loops and Tuples section
   of Ch 3. There had been references to the removed sections on the
   string % operator.

   format treatment. Removed explicit indices {0} from example files, to
   match code changes in the tutorial.

August 23, 2009

-  Python 3.1 changed the way floats are displayed as strings so the
   section on formatting floating point numbers now shows a more

   checkMouse. The tutorial has been changed to match.

-  Assorted small typos fixed.

February 28, 2009
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fixed broken picture display

-  Changed references to the range function to indicate it is a sequence
   generator. To see the whole sequence displayed in the Shell, you need
   list(range(n)), not just range(n).

-  Chapter 4: At present the university server is running Python 2.6.
   Made the remote cgi script links point to the working versions, not
   3.0 versions (output is the same).

-  Updated reserved word list to 3.0

December 29, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed the beginning of formatting with dictionaries, 1.12.2 so it is
independent of 1.10.4. 1.10.4 with numbered format parameters becomes
optional.

December 28, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clarifying edits in the sections on formatting with dictionaries, 1.12.2
and 1.12.3.

December 27, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Changes all over to convert to Python 3.0, though most of the changes
   are not conceptual.

-  The most significant topical involve making use fo the string format
   method introduced in Python 2.6. The use of the % string format
   operator has been completely removed. The format with {0}, {1}. {2},
   ... is initially introduced (later than the string % operator was
   introduced before). Later the syntax with dictionary references is
   introduced, and later in the tutorial this is widely used with the
   dictionary returned by locals(). This involved content changes in a
   number of places.

-  The incompatible minor language changes were introduced, principally:

   -  print function rather than statement

   -  input instead of raw\_input, and the old input function gone.

   -  // for integer division

-  There were some other minor changes like a set literal being
   displayed with braces.

-  Web site URL's were changed to refer to the 3.0 versions of
   materials.

-  A tool for making Python 3.0 the default under Windows if it is
   installed but not the default.

December 2, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WWW examples for Chapter 4: edited commonFormFields.html for further
clarification

October 29, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 3:
Added a real-world file processing example at the very end, bbassign.py,
that I use to modify Blackboard assignment downloads.
Chapter 4
Added extra reminders in several of the homework exercises.
Added extra real-world example survey processing programs

September 29, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 2:
Added missing example file printFile.py
Chapter 3
Added extra exercise on polygonal paths
Added extra example file bounceWhile.py

September 15, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 2:
Added playing computer in 2.2.1, previously referenced but not included.
Modified madlib2.py in 2.3.2 to simplify the changes for the madlib3.py
file exercise.

September 13, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed one typo that messed up all section numbers in chapter 1 after
1.5.2!

September 9, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General: fixed typos, misspellings, few words of elaboration...
Chapter 1:

-  Section 1.12.4 Added a small section illustrating the result of
   incorrect indentation

-  Section 1.12.8 More playing computer: clarified exercise

August 24, 2008:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General: fixed typos, misspellings
Chapter 1:

-  Section 1.2, 1.3: Expanded the introduction to the mechanics of
   dealling with the Shell, moving some explanation back to 1.2 where
   the Shell is first referenced.

-  Removed links to old flash videos that don't work right with current
   Flash

-  Refered to new example Windows shortcut file to start Idle for Python
   version 2.6 (now Beta) - no other 2.6 accomodations

-  Added comments and direct links to downloadable copies of the
   Tutorial and this change log.

-  Section 1.13.6 Successive modification loops: added intermediate
   example to the enumeration loop topic

Aug 18, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 2:
Moved major pieces of the string sections around + small change in
graphics

-  Section 1: OO notiation to the beginning, followed by all the basic
   string methods, including split and join. This way you can start on
   OO notation and then skip right to graphics if you like, or go on to
   the rest of the basic string operations and skip the harder string
   processing in the revised mad lib program.

-  Section 2-3: Split the mad lib section into two main sections, with
   the material on appending to lists and the intro to sets into the
   separate section 2.

-  Now the challenging string processing needed for the revised mad lib
   is in the last section on strings.

-  Section 4: Graphics Simplified the final animation example

Chapter 3:
Revised the introduction to a for-loop for a list of tuples in
chooseButton2.py

Aug 14, 2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chapter 1:

-  Much more playing computer and not all concentrated at the end, so it
   is illustrated with some of the initial examples. Reduced the
   complexity of the nested function call example.

-  Reworking of the format string section.

-  Moved the explanation of the fonts in syntax pattern earlier,
   changing the section numbers!
