Definition and Use of Dictionaries
----------------------------------

In common usage, a *dictionary* is a collection of words matched with
their definitions. Given a word, you can look up its definition.
Python has a built in dictionary type called dict which you can use
to create dictionaries with arbitrary definitions for character
strings. It can be used for the common usage, as in a simple
English-Spanish dictionary.

Look at the example program ``spanish1.py`` and run it.  

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/spanish1.py

First an empty dictionary is created using ``dict()``, and it is
assigned the descriptive name ``spanish``.

To refer to the definition for a word, you use the dictionary name,
follow it by the word inside *square brackets*. This notation can
either be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to make (or
remake) a definition, or it can be used in an expression (as in the
print functions), where its earlier definition is retrieved. For example,  ::

    spanish['hello'] = 'hola'

makes an entry in our ``spanish``
dictionary for ``'hello'`` , with definition ``'hola'``. ::

    print(spanish['red'])

retrieves the definition for ``'red'``, which is ``'rojo'``.

Since the Spanish dictionary is defined at the top-level, the
variable name ``spanish`` is still defined after the program runs:
After running the program, use ``spanish`` in the Shell to check
out the translations of some more words, other than ``'two'`` and
``'red'``.

.. index:: documentation string; function

*Creating* the dictionary is a well defined and quite different activity from the *use*
of the dictionary at the end of the code, 
so we can use a functions to encapsulate the task of creating the dictionary,
as in the example program ``spanish2.py``, which gives
the same result:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/spanish2.py

This code illustrates several things about functions.

-  First, like whole files, functions can have a documentation
   string immediately after the definition heading. It is a good idea
   to document the return value!

-  The dictionary that is created is returned, but the local
   variable name in the function, ``spanish``, is lost when the
   function terminates.

-  To remember the dictionary returned to ``main``, it needs a
   name. The name does not have to match the name used in
   ``createDictionary``. The name ``dictionary`` is descriptive.


We could also use the dictionary more extensively. The example
program :file:`spanish2a.py` is the same as above except it has the
following main method:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/spanish2a.py
   :start-after: return
   :end-before: program

Try it, and check that it makes sense.

Python dictionaries are actually more general than the common use
of dictionaries. They do not have to associate words and their
string definitions. They can associate many types of objects with
some arbitrary object. The more general Python terminology for word
and definition are *key* and *value*. Given a key, you can look up
the corresponding value. The only restriction on the key is that it
be an *immutable* type. This means that a value of the key's type
cannot be changed internally after it is initially created. Strings
and numbers are immutable. A dictionary is *mutable*: its value can
be changed internally. (You can add new definitions to it!) We will
see more mutable and immutable types later and explore more of the
internal workings of data types.

Number Dictionary Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a tiny Python program ``numDict.py`` that makes a
dictionary whose keys are the words 'one', 'two', 'three', and
'four', and whose corresponding values are the numerical
equivalents, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (of type int, not strings). Include code to
test the resulting dictionary by referencing several of the
definitions and printing the results.  

(This dictionary 
illustrates simply that the values in a Python dictionary are not
required to be strings.) 

.. index:: dictionary; format string
   format string; **dictionary
   

.. _Dictionaries-and-String:

Dictionaries and String Formatting
----------------------------------

At the end of the main function in ``spanish2a.py`` from the last
section, two strings are constructed and printed. The expressions
for the two strings include a sequence of literal strings
concatenated with interspersed values from a dictionary. There is a
much neater, more readable way to generate these strings. We will
develop this in several steps. The first string could be
constructed and printed as follows::

    numberFormat = 'Count in Spanish: {one}, {two}, {three}, ...'  
    withSubstitutions = numberFormat.format(one='uno', two='dos', three='tres') 
    print(withSubstitutions) 

There are several new ideas here!.  We are using an alternate form of format string
and format method parameters from those described in :ref:`Format-Strings`. 

Note the form of the string assigned the name ``numberFormat``: It
has the English words for numbers in *braces* where we want the
Spanish definitions substituted.  (This is unlike in :ref:`Format-Strings`,
where we had empty braces or a numerical index inside.)

As in :ref:`Format-Strings`, the second line uses *method* calling syntax. A reminder of
the 
syntax for methods:

    *object*.\ *methodname*\ ``(``\ *parameters*\ ``)``
     
has the object followed by a period followed by the method name,
and further parameters in parentheses.

In the example above, the object is the string called
``numberFormat``. The method is named ``format``. The parameters in
this case are all *keyword* parameters. You have already seen
keyword parameter ``sep`` used in print function
calls. In this particular application, the keywords are chosen to
include all the words that appear enclosed in braces in the
``numberFormat`` string.

When the string ``numberFormat`` has the ``format`` method applied
to it with the given keyword parameters, a new string is created
with substitutions into the places enclosed in braces. The
substitutions are just the values given by the keyword parameters.
Hence the printed result is

    Count in Spanish: uno, dos, tres, ...

.. index::  **; dictionary

Now we go one step further: The keyword parameters associate the
keyword names with the values after the equal signs. The dictionary
from ``spanish2a.py`` includes exactly the same associations. There
is a special notation allowing such a dictionary to supply keyword
parameters. Assuming ``dictionary`` is the Spanish dictionary from
``spanish2a.py``, the method call ::

    numberFormat.format(one='uno', two='dos', three='tres')

returns the same string as ::

    numberFormat.format(**dictionary)

The special syntax ** before the dictionary indicates that
the dictionary is not to be treated as a *single* actual parameter.
Instead keyword arguments for *all* the entries in the dictionary
effectively appear in its place.

Below is a substitute for the main method in ``spanish2a.py``. The
whole revised program is in example program ``spanish3.py``: 

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/spanish3.py
   :start-after: return
   :end-before: program

In this ``main`` function the string with the numbers is constructed
in steps as discussed
above. The printing of the string with the Spanish colors is coded
more concisely. There are not named variables for the format string
or the resulting formatted string. You are free to use either
coding approach.

In general, use this syntax for the string format method with a
dictionary, returning a new formatted string:

    *formatString*\ ``.format(**``\ *aDictionary*\ ``)``

where the format string contains dictionary keys in braces where
you want the dictionary values substituted. The dictionary key
names must follow the rules for legal identifiers.

At this point we have discussed in some detail everything that went
into the first sample program, ``madlib.py``, in
:ref:`Madlib-Explained-I`! This is certainly the most
substantial program so far.

Look at ``madlib.py`` again, see how we have used most of the ideas
so far. If you want more description, you might look at section
:ref:`Madlib-Explained-I` again (or for the first time): it should
make much more sense now.

We will use ``madlib.py`` as a basis for more substantial
modifications in structure in :ref:`The-Revised-Mad`.


.. _Your-Mad-Lib-Ex:

Mad Lib Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To confirm your better understanding of ``madlib.py``, load it in
the editor, *rename* it as ``myMadlib.py``, and
*modify it to have a less lame story*, with more and different
entries in the dictionary. Make sure addPick is called for each key
in your format string. Test your version.

.. index::
   double: dictionary; variable


.. _Locals-Dict:
    
Dictionaries and Python Variables
---------------------------------

Dictionaries are central to the implementation of Python. Each
variable identifier is associated with a particular value. These
relationships are stored in dictionaries in Python, and these
dictionaries are accessible to the user: You can use the function
call ``locals()`` to return a dictionary containing all the current
local variables names as keys and all their values as the
corresponding dictionary values. This dictionary can be used with
the string format method, so you can embed local variable names in
a format string and use them very easily!

For example, run the example program ``arithDict.py``

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/arithDict.py

Note the variable names inside braces in ``formatStr,`` and the
dictionary reference used as the format parameter is
``**locals()``.

A string like ``formatS`tr`` is probably the most readable way to
code the creation of a string from a collection of literal strings
and program values. The ending part of the syntax,
``.format(**locals())``, may appear a bit strange, but it is
very useful! It clearly
indicate how values are embedded into the format string, and avoids having
a long list of parameters to ``format``.

The example program ``hello_you4.py`` does the same thing as the
earlier hello_you versions, but with a dictionary reference:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello_you4.py

**F-Strings**: (Optional, but handy!)
A simplification for formatting added in Python 3.6 is *f-strings*.  
They have many features, but the simplest thing 
is to shorten formatting of a literal string with 
local variable references like above:
Merely add an ``f`` immediately *before* the literal format string,
and eliminate the ``.format(**locals())``.
See example arithfstring.py:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/arithfstring.py


.. _QuotientStringDict:
    
Quotient String Dictionary Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create :file:`quotientDict.py` by modifying :file:`quotientReturn.py` in
:ref:`QuotientStringEx` so that the ``quotientString`` function
accomplishes the same thing:  Put local variable names inside
the braces of a format string, and either process the 
format string by appending ``.format(**locals())`` or else make
the format string into an f-string.
If you use meaningful names for the variables, the
format string should be particularly easy to understand.
