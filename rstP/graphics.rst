Graphics
========

Graphics make programming more fun for many people. To fully
introduce graphics would involve many ideas that would be a
distraction now. This section introduces a simplified graphics
module developed by John Zelle for use with his Python Programming
book. My slight elaboration of his package is ``graphics.py`` in the
example programs.

..  warning::
    You need the file ``graphics.py`` in the same folder as
    any graphics program you write.  Be sure to save
    any graphics program you write in such a folder
    (like my examples folder).  The easiest way
    to ensure this is to start in the desired folder,
    as discussed in :ref:`idle-for-editing`.
    
..  warning::
    To work on the most systems, this version of graphics.py
    *cannot be used from the Idle shell*. There is an issue
    with the use of multiple threads of execution.  
    
.. _Graphics-Introduction:
    
A Graphics Introduction
-------------------------------------

..  note::
    You will just be a *user* of the ``graphics.py`` code, so you do
    *not* need to understand the inner workings! It uses all sorts of
    features of Python that are way beyond these tutorials. There is
    *no particular need* to open ``graphics.py`` in the Idle editor.

Load into Idle and start running example ``graphIntroSteps.py``, 
or start running from the operating system folder.  
Each time you press return,
look at the screen and read the explanation for the next line(s).  

Press return::

    from graphics import *
    win = GraphWin()

Zelle's graphics are not a part of the standard Python
distribution. For the Python interpreter to find Zelle's module, it
must be *imported*. The first line above makes all the types of object of
Zelle's module accessible, as if they were already defined like
built-in types ``str`` or ``list``.

Look around on your screen, and possibly *underneath* other windows:
There should be a new window labeled "Graphics Window", created
by the second line. Bring it
to the top, and preferably drag it around to make it visible beside
your Shell window. A ``GraphWin`` is a type of object from Zelle's
graphics package that automatically displays a window when it is
created. The assignment statement remembers the window object as
``win`` for future reference. (This will be our standard name for
our graphics window object.) A small window, 200 by 200 *pixels* is
created. A *pixel* is the smallest little square that can by
displayed on your screen. Modern screen usually have more than 1000
pixels across the whole screen.

Press return::

    pt = Point(100, 50)

This creates a ``Point`` object and assigns it the name ``pt``.
Unlike when a ``GraphWin`` is created, 
*nothing is immediately displayed:*
In theory you could have more than one ``GraphWin``.
Zelle designed the graphics module so you must tell Python into
*which* ``GraphWin`` to draw the ``Point``. A ``Point`` object,
like each of the graphical objects that can be drawn on a
``GraphWin``, has a method [#]_ ``draw``. 

Press return::

    pt.draw(win)

Now you should see the ``Point`` if you look hard in the Graphics
Window - it shows as a single, small, black pixel. Graphics windows
have a Cartesian (x,y) coordinate system. The dimensions are
initially measured in pixels. The first coordinate is the
horizontal coordinate, measured from left to right, so 100 is about
half way across the 200 pixel wide window. The second coordinate,
for the vertical direction, increases going *down* from the top of
the window by default, not *up* as you are likely to expect from
geometry or algebra class. The coordinate 50 out of the total 200
vertically should be about 1/4 of the way *down* from the top. We
will see later that we can reorient the coordinate system to fit
our taste.

Henceforth you will see a draw method call after each object is created,
so there is something to see.

Press return::

    cir = Circle(pt, 25) 
    cir.draw(win) 

The first line creates a ``Circle`` object with center at the
previously defined ``pt`` and with radius 25. This object is
remembered with the name ``cir``. As with all graphics objects that
may be drawn within a ``GraphWin``, it is only made visible by
explicitly using its ``draw`` method.

So far, everything has been drawn in the default color black.
Graphics objects like a Circle have methods to change their colors.
Basic color name strings are recognized.
You can choose the color
for the circle outline as well as filling in the inside. 

Press return::

    cir.setOutline('red') 
    cir.setFill('blue') 

Note the method names.  They can be used with other kinds of
Graphics objects, too.
(We delay a discussion of fancier colors until :ref:`Color-Names` and
:ref:`Custom-Colors`.)

Press return::

    line = Line(pt, Point(150, 100)) 
    line.draw(win) 

A Line object is constructed with two Points as parameters. In this
case we use the previously named Point, ``pt``, and specify another
Point directly. Technically the ``Line`` object is a *segment* between
the the two points.

.. warning::
   In Python ``(150, 100)`` is a ``tuple``, *not* a ``Point``.  To make
   a ``Point``, you must use the full constructor: ``Point(150, 100)``.
   ``Point``\ s, not ``tuple``\ s, must be used in the constructors for 
   *all graphics objects*.

A rectangle is also specified by two points. The points must be
diagonally opposite corners.  

Press return::

    rect = Rectangle(Point(20, 10), pt) 
    rect.draw(win) 

In this simple system,
a ``Rectangle`` is restricted to have horizontal and vertical sides.  
A ``Polygon``, introduced in the next section, is used for all more 
general straight-sided shapes.

You can move objects around in a GraphWin. Shortly this will be handy for
animation. The parameters to the ``move`` method are the
amount to shift the x and y coordinates. See if you can guess the
result before you *press return*::

    line.move(10, 40)

Did you remember that the y coordinate increases *down* the
screen?

Take your last look at the Graphics Window, and make sure that all
the steps make sense. Then destroy the window ``win`` with the
``GraphWin`` method ``close``.

Press return::

    win.close()


The example program 
``graphIntro.py``
starts with the same graphics code as ``graphIntoSteps.py``, 
but without the need for pressing returns.  

An addition I have made to Zelle's package is the ability to print
a string value of graphics objects for debugging purposes.
If some graphics object isn't visible because it is underneath
something else of off the screen, temporarily adding 
this sort of output might be a
good reality check.

At the end of ``graphIntro.py``,
I added print lines to illustrate the debugging possibilities::

	print('cir:', cir)
	print('line:', line)
	print('rect:', rect)

You can load ``graphIntro.py`` into Idle, run it, and add further lines
to experiment if you like.  Of course you will not see their effect until
you run the whole program!  Unfortunately the graphics do not work when
entered directly into the Shell.


.. _Sample-Graphics:
                                                   
Sample Graphics Programs
------------------------

In ``graphIntro.py``, a prompt to end the graphics program appeared
in the Shell
window, requiring you to pay attention to two windows.
Instead consider a very simple example program, ``face.py``, 
where all the action takes place in the graphics window.
The only interaction is
to click the mouse to close the graphics window. 

In Windows, have a folder
window open to the Python examples folder containing ``face.py``,
where your operating system setup may allow you be just 
double click on the icon for ``face.py`` to run it.  If that does not
work on your system, you can always run from inside Idle. 

After you have checked out the picture, click with the mouse inside
the picture, as requested, to terminate the program.

After you have run the program, you can examine the program in Idle
or look below. The whole program is shown first; smaller pieces of
it are discussed later:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/face.py

Let us look at individual parts.

*Until further notice the set-off code is for you to read and have explained.*
::
                                                   
    from graphics import *

Immediately after the documentation string, always have the import
line in your graphics program, to allow easy access to the
graphics.py module. ::

    win = GraphWin('Face', 200, 150) # give title and dimensions 
    win.yUp() # make right side up coordinates! 

The first line shows the more *general* parameters for constructing a
new GraphWin, a window title plus width and height in pixels. The second
line shows how to turn the coordinate system right-side-up, so the
y coordinate increases *up* the screen, using the ``yUp`` method.
(This is one of my additions to Zelle's graphics.)
Thereafter, all coordinates are given in the new
coordinate system. All the lines of code up to
this point in the program are my *standard* graphics program
starting lines (other than the specific values for the title and
dimensions). You will likely start your programs with similar
code. ::

        head = Circle(Point(40,100), 25) # set center and radius 
        head.setFill('yellow') 
        head.draw(win) 
     
        eye1 = Circle(Point(30, 105), 5) 
        eye1.setFill('blue') 
        eye1.draw(win) 

The lines above create two circles, in each case specifying the
centers directly. They are filled in and made visible.
Also note, that because the earlier
``win.yUp`` call put the coordinates in the normal
orientation, the y coordinate, 100 and 105, are above the middle of the
150 pixel high window.  

If the code was switched to put the head part second, the
eye would become hidden.  The most recent thing
drawn is on top.  ::

        eye2 = Line(Point(45, 105), Point(55, 105)) # set endpoints 
        eye2.setWidth(3) 
        eye2.draw(win) 

The code above draws and displays a line, and illustrates another
method available to graphics object, ``setWidth``, making a
*thicker* line.  ::

        mouth = Oval(Point(30, 90), Point(50, 85)) # set corners of bounding box 
        mouth.setFill('red') 
        mouth.draw(win) 

The code above illustrates another kind of graphics object, an ``Oval``
(or ellipse). There are several ways an oval could be specified.
Zelle chose to have you specify the corners of the bounding box
that is just as high and as wide as the oval. This rectangle is
only imagined, not actually drawn. (If you want to see such a
rectangle, create a Rectangle object with the same two Points as
parameters....) ::

    label = Text(Point(100, 120), 'A face')
    label.draw(win)

The code above illustrates how a ``Text`` object is used to place text
on the window.  The parameters to construct the ``Text`` object are the
point at the *center* of the text, and the text string itself. 

The exact coordinates for the parts were determined by a number of
trial-and-error refinements to the program. An advantage of
graphics is that you can *see* the results of your programming, and
make changes if you do not like the results!  In this simple
system, there is not a good way to predict the dimensions of
text on the screen.

The final action is to have the user signal to close the window.
Just as with waiting for keyboard input from ``input``,
it is important to *prompt* the user before waiting for
a response! In a GraphWin, that means using prompt must be made with
a ``Text`` object displayed explicitly before the response is expected. ::

    message = Text(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 20), 'Click anywhere to quit.') 
    message.draw(win) 
    win.getMouse() 
    win.close() 

The new addition to the Text parameters here is ``win.getWidth()``
to obtain the window width.
(There is also a ``win.getHeight()``.)  
Using ``win.getWidth()/2`` means the horizontal position is set up to be
centered, half way across the window's width. 

After the first two lines draw the prompting text, the line
``win.getMouse()`` *waits* for a mouse click. In this program, the
position of the mouse click is not important.
(In the next example the position of
this mouse click will be used.) As you have seen before,
``win.close()`` closes the graphics window.

While our earlier text-based Python programs have automatically
terminated after the last line finishes executing, that is not true
for programs that create new windows: The graphics window must be
explicitly closed. The ``win.close()`` is necessary.

We will generally want to prompt the user to finally close the
graphics window.  Because such a sequence is so common, I have
added another method for Zelle's ``GraphWin`` objects, ``promptClose``,
so the last four lines can be reduced to ::

    win.promptClose(win.getWidth()/2, 20)

where the only specific data needed is the coordinates of the
center of the prompt.
 
The modified program is in ``face2.py``.
You can copy the form of this program for other simple programs
that just draw a picture. The size and title on the window will
change, as well as the specific graphical objects, positions, and
colors. Something like the last line can be used to terminate
the program.

.. warning::

   If you write a program with a bug, 
   and the program bombs out while there is a GraphWin on the screen, 
   a dead GraphWin lingers.   The best way to clean things up
   is to make the Shell window be the current window and select from the menu
   :menuselection:`Shell --> Restart Shell`.

Another simple drawing example is ``balloons.py``. Feel free to run
it and look at the code in Idle. Note that the steps for the
creation of all three balloons are identical, except for the
location of the center of each balloon, so a loop over a list of
the centers makes sense.  

The next example, ``triangle.py``, illustrates similar starting and
ending code. In addition it explicitly interacts with the user.
Rather than the code specifying literal coordinates for all
graphical objects, the program remembers
the Points where the user clicked the mouse. 
They are used as the vertices of a
triangle. 

Return to the directory window for the Python examples. In Windows
you may be able to double click on the icon for ``triangle.py`` to run it.
Or on a Mac, you can run it using the Python Launcher, rather than Idle.

While running the program, follow the prompts in the graphics
window and click with the mouse as requested.

After you have run the program, you can examine the program in Idle
or look below:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/triangle.py

Let us look at individual parts.

The lines *before* the new line::

    win.setBackground('yellow')

are standard starting lines (except for the specific values chosen
for the width, height, and title). The background color is a
property of the whole graphics window that you can set.  ::

    message = Text(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 20), 'Click on three points') 
    message.setTextColor('red') 
    message.setStyle('italic') 
    message.setSize(20) 
    message.draw(win) 

Again a ``Text`` object is created.  This is the prompt for user action.
These lines illustrate most of the ways the appearance of a Text
object may be
modified, with results like in most word processors. The reference pages
for ``graphics.py`` give the details.  This reference is introduced shortly in
:ref:`Graphics-Documentation`.

After the prompt, the program looks for a response::

    # Get and draw three vertices of triangle 
    p1 = win.getMouse() 
    p1.draw(win) 
 
    p2 = win.getMouse() 
    p2.draw(win) 
 
    p3 = win.getMouse() 
    p3.draw(win) 

The ``win.getMouse()`` method (with no parameters), waits for you
to click the mouse inside ``win``. Then the ``Point`` where the
mouse was clicked is *returned*. In this code three mouse clicks
are waited for, remembered in variables ``p1``, ``p2``, and ``p3``,
and the points are drawn.

Next we introduce a very versatile type of graphical object, a
``Polygon``, which may have any number of vertices specified in a
list as its parameter. We see that the methods ``setFill`` and
``setOutline`` that we used earlier on a ``Circle``, and the
``setWidth`` method we used for a ``Line``, also apply to a
``Polygon``, (and also to other graphics objects). ::

    vertices = [p1, p2, p3] 
    triangle = Polygon(vertices) 
    triangle.setFill('gray') 
    triangle.setOutline('cyan') 
    triangle.setWidth(4)  
    triangle.draw(win) 

Besides changing the style of a Text object, the text itself may be changed::
 
    message.setText('Click anywhere to quit') 

Then lines responding to this prompt::

    win.getMouse() 
    win.close() 

If you want to use an existing Text object to display the quitting prompt,
as I did here, I provide a variation on my window closing method that
could replace the last three lines::

    win.promptClose(message)

An existing Text object may be given as parameter rather than coordinates
for a new text object.  The complete code with that substitution is in
``triangle2.py``.

If you want to make regular polygons or stars, you need some trigonometry,
*not required for this tutorial*, but you can see its use in example
``polygons.py``.

.. index:: pyw

.. _pyw:
                                                   
A Windows Operating System Specialization: .pyw
-----------------------------------------------

This Windows-specific section is not essential. It does describe
how to make some Windows graphical programs run with less clutter.

If you ran the triangle.py program by double clicking its icon
under Windows, you might have noticed a console window first
appearing, followed by the graphics window. For this program, there
was no keyboard input or screen output through the console window,
so the console window was unused and unnecessary. In such cases,
under Windows, you can change the source file extension from .py to
.pyw, suppressing the display of the console window. If you are
using Windows, change the filename ``triangle.py`` to ``triangle.pyw``,
double click on the icon in its directory folder, and check it out.

The distinction is irrelevant inside Idle, which always has its
Shell window.

.. index:: event
 
.. _EventDriven:
                                                   
Graphics.py vs. Event Driven Graphics
-------------------------------------

This optional section only looks forward to more elaborate graphics
systems than are used in this tutorial.

One limitation of the ``graphics.py`` module is that it is not robust
if a graphics window is closed by clicking on the standard
operating system close button on the title bar. If you close a
graphics window that way, you are likely to get a Python error
message. On the other hand, if your program creates a graphics
window and then terminates abnormally due to some *other* error,
the graphics window may be left orphaned. In this case the close
button on the title bar is important: it is the easiest method to
clean up and get rid of the window!

This lack of robustness is tied to the simplification designed into
the graphics module. Modern graphics environments are
*event driven*. The program can be interrupted by input from many
sources including mouse clicks and key presses. This style of
programming has a considerable learning curve. In Zelle's graphics
package, the complexities of the event driven model are pretty well
hidden. If the programmer wants user input, only one type can be
specified at a time (either a mouse click in the graphics window
via the getMouse method, or via the ``input`` keyboard
entry methods into the Shell window).

.. _Graphics-Documentation:
 
The Documentation for ``graphics.py``
-------------------------------------

Thus far various parts of Zelle's graphics package have been
introduced by example. A systematic reference to Zelle's graphics
package with the form of all function calls is at
http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html.
We have introduced most of the important concepts and methods.

One special graphics input object type, ``Entry``, will be
discussed later. You might skip it for now. Another section of the
reference that will not be pursued in the tutorials is the
``Image`` class.

Meanwhile you can look at
http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html.
It is important to pay attention to the organization of the
reference: Most graphics object share a number of common methods.
Those methods are described together, first. Then, under the
headings for specific types, only the specialized additional
methods are discussed.

The version for this Tutorial has a few elaborations.
Here is all their documentation together:

.. index::
   graphics methods added; yUp
   yUp

**GraphWin method yUp (y increases upward)**
    When you first create a GraphWin,
    the y coordinates increase down the screen.
    To reverse to the normal orientation use my GraphWin yUp method. ::

        win = Graphwin('Right side up', 300, 400)
        win.yUp()

 
.. index::
   graphics methods added; promptClose
   promptClose

**GraphWin method promptClose (Prompt and Close Graphics Window)**
    You generally want to continue displaying your graphics window
    until the user chooses to have it closed.
    The GraphWin promptClose method posts a prompt,
    waits for a mouse click, and closes the GraphWin.
    There are two ways to call it, depending on whether you want to
    use an existing Text object, or just specify a location for
    the center of the prompt. ::

        win.promptClose(win.getWidth()/2, 30) # specify x, y coordinates of prompt

    or  ::

        msg = Text(Point(100, 50), 'Original message...')  
        msg.draw(win)
        # ...
        # ... just important that there is a drawn Text object
        win.promptClose(msg)  # use existing Text object

.. index::
   graphics methods added; graphics object string conversion

**String Representations of all Graphics Object Types**
    Each graphical type can be converted to a string or printed,
    and a descriptive string is produced (for debugging purposes).
    It only shows position, not other parts of the state of the object. ::

        >>> pt = Point(30, 50)
        >>> print(pt)
        Point(30, 50)
        >>> ln = Line(pt, Point(100, 150))
        >>> print(ln)
        Line(Point(30, 50), Point(100, 150))


Scene Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make a program ``scene.py`` creating a scene with the graphics
methods. You are likely to need to adjust the positions of objects
by trial and error until you get the positions you want.
*Make sure you have graphics.py in the same directory as your program.*

Changing Scene Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Elaborate the scene program above so it becomes ``changeScene.py``,
and changes one or more times when you click the mouse (and use
``win.getMouse()``). You may use the position of the mouse click to
affect the result, or it may just indicate you are ready to go on
to the next view.

.. _Issues-with-Mutable:

Issues with Mutable Objects
---------------------------

Zelle chose to have the constructor for a Rectangle take diagonally
opposite corner points as parameters. Suppose you prefer to specify
only one corner and also specify the width and height of the
rectangle. You might come up with the following function,
``makeRect``, to return such a new Rectangle. *Read* the following
attempt::

    def makeRect(corner, width, height): 
        '''Return a new Rectangle given one corner Point and the dimensions.''' 
        corner2 = corner 
        corner2.move(width, height) 
        return Rectangle(corner, corner2) 

The second corner must be created to use in the ``Rectangle``
constructor, and it is done above in two steps. Start ``corner2``
from the given ``corner`` and shift it by the dimensions of the
Rectangle to the other corner. With both corners specified, you can
use Zelle's version of the Rectangle constructor.

Unfortunately this is an *incorrect* argument. Run the example
program ``makeRectBad.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/makeRectBad.py

By stated design, this program should draw a rectangle with one
corner at the point (20,\ 50) and the other corner at
(20+250,\ 50+200) or the point (270,\ 250), and so the rectangle should take
up most of the 300 by 300 window. When you run it however that is
not what you see. Look carefully. You should just see one ``Point``
toward the upper right corner, where the second corner *should* be.
Since a ``Rectangle`` was being drawn, it looks like it is the
tiniest of ``Rectangle``\ s, where the opposite corners are at the
same point! Hm, well the program *did* make the corners be the same
*initially*. *Recall* we set ::

    corner2 = corner

What happens after that?

*Read and follow the details of what happens.*

We need to take a much more careful look at what naming an object
means. A good way to visualize this association between a name and
an object is to draw an arrow from the name to the object
associated with it. The object here is a ``Point``, which has an x
and y coordinate describing its state, so when the ``makeRect``
method is started the parameter name ``corner`` is associated with
the actual parameter, a ``Point`` with coordinates (20, 50).

.. figure:: images/alias1.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 252.75 pt
   
Next, the assignment statement associates the name ``corner2`` with
the same object. It is another name, or *alias*, for the original
``Point``.

.. figure:: images/alias2.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 252.75 pt
   
The next line, ::

    corner2.move(width, height)

internally changes or *mutates* the ``Point`` object, and since in
this case width is 250 and height is 200, the coordinates of the
``Point`` associated with the name ``corner2`` change to 20+250=270
and 50+200=250:

.. figure:: images/alias3.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 252.75 pt

Look! The name ``corner`` is still associated with the same object,
but that object has changed internally! That is the problem: we
wanted to keep the name ``corner`` associated with the point with
*original* coordinates, but it has been *modified*.

The solution is to use the ``clone`` method that is defined for all
the graphical objects in graphics.py. It creates a *separate*
object, which is a copy with an equivalent state. We just need to
change the line ::

    corner2 = corner

to ::

    corner2 = corner.clone()

A diagram of the situation after the cloning is:

.. figure:: images/clone1.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 250.5 pt

Though ``corner`` and ``corner2`` refer to points with equivalent
coordinates, they do not refer to the same *object*. Then after ::

    corner2.move(width, height)

we get:

.. figure:: images/clone2.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 250.5 pt
   
No conflict: ``corner`` and ``corner2`` refer to the corners we
want. Run the corrected example program, ``makeRectangle.py``.

.. _More-on-Mutable:

More on Mutable and Immutable Types
-----------------------------------

Read this section if you want a deeper understanding of the
significance of mutable and immutable objects.

This alias problem only came up because a ``Point`` is mutable. We
had no such problems with the immutable types ``int`` or ``str``.

*Read and follow the discussion of the following code.*

Just for comparison, consider the corresponding diagrams for code
with ``int``\ s that looks superficially similar::

    a = 2 
    b = a 
    b = b + 3 

After the first two lines we have an alias again:

.. figure:: images/intAlias1.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 210 pt

The third line does not change the ``int`` object 2. The result of the
addition operation refers to a *different* object, 5, and the name
``b`` is assigned to it:

.. figure:: images/intAlias2.*
   :align: center
   :alt: image
   :width: 207 pt

Hence ``a`` is still associated with the integer 2 - no conflict.

It is not technically correct to think of ``b`` as *being* the
number 2, and then 5, but a little sloppiness of thought does not
get you in trouble with *immutable* types. With mutable types,
however, be very careful of aliases. Then it is very important to
remember the indirectness: that a name is not the same thing as the
object it refers to.

Another mutable type is ``list``. A list can be cloned with the
slice notation: [:]. Try the following in the *Shell*: [#]_ ::

    nums = [1, 2, 3]
    numsAlias = nums
    numsClone = nums[:] 
    nums.append(4) 
    numsAlias.append(5) 
    nums 
    numsAlias
    numsClone

Animation
---------

Run the example program, backAndForth0.py. The whole program is
shown below for convenience. Then each individual new part of the
code is discussed individually:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backAndForth0.py

*Read the discussion below of pieces of the code from the program above.*
Do not try to execute fragments alone.

There are both an old and a new form of ``import`` statement::

    from graphics import * 
    import time 

The program uses a function from the time module. The syntax used
for the time module is actually the safer and more typical way to
import a module. As you will see later in the program, the
``sleep`` function used from the ``time`` module will be referenced
as ``time.sleep()``. This tells the Python interpreter to look in
the ``time`` module for the ``sleep`` function.

If we had used the ``import`` statement ::

    from time import *

then the ``sleep`` function could just be referenced with
``sleep()``. This is obviously easier, but it obscures the fact
that the ``sleep`` function is not a part of the current module.
Also several modules that a program imports might have functions
with the same name. With the individual module name prefix, there
is no ambiguity. Hence the form ``import moduleName`` is actually
safer than ``from moduleName import *``.

You might think that all modules could avoid using any of the same
function names with a bit of planning. To get an idea of the
magnitude of the issue, have a look at the number of modules
available to Python. Try the following in the in the *Shell* (and
likely wait a number of seconds)::

    help('modules')

Without module names to separate things out, it would be very hard
to totally avoid name collisions with the enormous number of
modules you see displayed, that are all available to Python!

Back to the current example program: The main program starts with
standard window creation, and then makes three objects::

    rect = Rectangle(Point(200, 90), Point(220, 100)) 
    rect.setFill('blue') 
    rect.draw(win) 
 
    cir1 = Circle(Point(40,100), 25) 
    cir1.setFill('yellow') 
    cir1.draw(win) 
 
    cir2 = Circle(Point(150,125), 25) 
    cir2.setFill('red') 
    cir2.draw(win) 

.. index::
   graphics; order of drawing
   order of drawing

Zelle's reference pages do not mention the fact that the *order* in
which these object are first *drawn* is significant. If objects
overlap, the ones which used the draw method later appear on top.
Other object methods like ``setFill`` or ``move`` do not alter
which are in front of which. This becomes significant when ``cir1``
moves. The moving ``cir1`` goes over the rectangle and behind
``cir2``. (Run the program again if you missed that.)

.. index:: sleep
   time.sleep
   animation; sleep

The animation starts with the code for a simple repeat loop::

    for i in range(46):  # animate cir1 to the right 
        cir1.move(5, 0) 
        time.sleep(.05) 

This very simple loop animates ``cir1`` moving in a straight line
to the right. As in a movie, the illusion of continuous motion is
given by jumping only a short distance each time (increasing the
horizontal coordinate by 5). The ``time.sleep`` function, mentioned
earlier, takes as parameter a time in seconds to have the program
sleep, or delay, before continuing with the iteration of the loop.
This delay is important, because modern computers are so fast, that
the intermediate motion would be invisible without the delay. The
delay can be given as a decimal, to allow the time to be a fraction
of a second.

The next three lines are almost identical to the previous lines,
and move the circle to the left (-5 in the horizontal coordinate
each time). ::

    for i in range(46):  # animate cir1 to the left 
        cir1.move(-5, 0) 
        time.sleep(.05) 

The next example program, backAndForth1.py, it just a slight
variation, looking to the user just like the last version. Only the
small changes are shown below. This version was written after
noticing how similar the two animation loops are, suggesting an
improvement to the program: Animating any object to move in a
straight line is a logical abstraction well expressed via a
function.

The loop in the initial version of the program contained a number
of arbitrarily chosen constants, which make sense to turn into
parameters. Also, the object to be animated does not need to be
``cir1``, it can be any of the drawable objects in the graphics
package. The name ``shape`` is used to make this a parameter::

    def moveOnLine(shape, dx, dy, repetitions, delay): 
        for i in range(repetitions): 
            shape.move(dx, dy) 
            time.sleep(delay) 

Then in the main function the two similar animation loops are
reduced to a line for each direction::

    moveOnLine(cir1, 5, 0, 46, .05) 
    moveOnLine(cir1, -5, 0, 46, .05) 

Make sure you see these two lines with function calls behave the
same way as the two animation loops in the main program of the
original version.

Run the next example version, backAndForth2.py. The changes are
more substantial here, and the display of the whole program is
followed by display and discussion of the individual changes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backAndForth2.py

*Read the following discussion of program parts.*

Moving a single elementary shape is rather limiting. It is much
more interesting to compose a more complicated combination, like
the face from the earlier example ``face.py``. To animate such a
combination, you cannot use the old ``moveOnLine`` function,
because we want all the parts to move *together*, not one eye all
the way across the screen and then have the other eye catch up! A
variation on ``moveOnLine`` is needed where all the parts move
together. We need all the parts of the face to move one step,
then sleep *once*, and all move again, sleep *once*, .... 
This could all be coded in a single
method, but there are really two ideas here:

#. Moving a group of objects one step.

#. Animating a number of moves for the group.

This suggests two functions. Another issue is how to handle a group
of elementary graphics objects. The most basic combination of
objects in Python is a ``list``, so we assume a parameter
``shapeList``, which is a ``list`` of elementary graphics objects.
For the first function, ``moveAll,`` just move all the objects in
the list one step. Since we assume a *list* of objects and we want
to move *each*, this suggests a for-each loop::

    def moveAll(shapeList, dx, dy): 
        ''' Move all shapes in shapeList by (dx, dy).'''    
        for shape in shapeList:  
            shape.move(dx, dy) 
                
Having this function, we can easily write the second function
``moveAllOnLine``, with a simple change from the ``moveOnLine``
function, substituting the ``moveAll`` function for the line with
the ``move`` method:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backAndForth2.py
   :start-after:  shape.move(dx, dy)
   :end-before: main()
           
The code in main to construct the face is the same as in the
earlier example ``face.py``. Once all the pieces are constructed
and colored, they must be placed in a list, for use in
``moveAllOnLine``::

    faceList = [head, eye1, eye2, mouth]

Then, later, the animation uses the ``faceList`` to make the face
go back and forth::

    moveAllOnLine(faceList, 5, 0, 46, .05) 
    moveAllOnLine(faceList, -5, 0, 46, .05) 

This version of the program has encapsulated and generalized the
moving and animating by creating functions and adding parameters
that can be substituted. Again, make sure you see how the functions
communicate to make the whole program work. This is an important
and non-trivial use of functions.

In fact all parts of the face do *not* actually move
at once: The moveAll loop code moves each part of the face separately,
in sequence.  Depending on your computer setup,
all the parts of the face may *appear* to move together.
Again, the computer is much faster than our eyes.  On a computer that
repaints the screen fast enough, the only images we
notice are the *ones on the screen when the animation is sleeping*.  

..  note::
    
    On a fast enough computer 
    you can make many consecutive changes to an image before the next sleep
    statement, and they all *appear* to happen at once in the animation.

**Optional refinement**: Not
all computers are set up for the same graphics speed in Python.  One machine that
I use animates :file:`backAndForth2.py` quite well.   Another seems to have the
mouth wiggle.  On the latter sort of machine, during animation it is useful not to have
visible screen changes for every individual move.  Instead you can explicitly tell the 
computer when it is the right time to redraw the screen.  The computer can store
changes and then *flush* them to the screen.  Withholding updates is controlled
by ``win.autoflush``.  It starts as True, but can be changed to False before animation.
When set to False, you must call ``win.flush()`` every time you want the screen
refreshed.  That is going to be just before the ``time.sleep()`` in an animation.
In :file:`backAndForth2Flush.py` this is illustrated, with ``moveAllOnLine`` replaced by
``moveAllOnLineFlush``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backAndForth2Flush.py
   :start-after:  shape.move(dx, dy)
   :end-before: main()


Run the next example program ``backAndForth3.py``. 

The final version, :file:`backAndForth3.py` and its variant,
:file:`backAndForth3Flush.py`, use the observation that
the code to make a face embodies one unified idea, suggesting
encapsulation inside a function. Once you have encapsulated the
code to make a face, we can make several faces! Then the problem
with the original code for the face is that all the positions for
the facial elements are hard-coded: The face can only be drawn in
one position. The full listing of ``backAndForth3.py`` below
includes a ``makeFace`` function with a parameter for the position
of the center of the face.

Beneath the listing of the whole program is a discussion of the
individual changes:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/backAndForth3.py

*Read the following discussion of program parts.*

As mentioned above, the face construction function allows a
parameter to specify where the center of the face is. The other
parameter is the GraphWin that will contain the face. ::

    def makeFace(center, win):

then the head is easily drawn, using this ``center``, rather than the previous
``cir1`` with its specific center point (40, 100)::

        head = Circle(center, 25) 
        head.setFill('yellow') 
        head.draw(win) 

For the remaining ``Point``\ s used in the construction there is the
issue of keeping the right relation to the center. This is
accomplished much as in the creation of the second corner point in
the ``makeRectangle`` function in Section :ref:`Issues-with-Mutable`. A
clone of the original center Point is made, and then moved by the
*difference* in the positions of the originally specified
``Point``\ s. For instance, in the original face, the center of the
head and first eye were at (40, 110) and (30, 115) respectively.
That means a
shift between the two coordinates of (-10, 5), since 30-40 = -10
and 130-110 = 20.  ::

    eye1Center = center.clone() # face positions are relative to the center 
    eye1Center.move(-10, 5)     # locate further points in relation to others 
    eye1 = Circle(eye1Center, 5) 
    eye1.setFill('blue') 
    eye1.draw(win) 

The only other changes to the face are similar, cloning and moving
``Point``\ s, rather than specifying them with explicit coordinates. ::

    eye2End1 = eye1Center.clone() 
    eye2End1.move(15, 0) 
    eye2End2 = eye2End1.clone() 
    eye2End2.move(10, 0) 
    eye2 = Line(eye2End1, eye2End2) 
    eye2.setWidth(3) 
    eye2.draw(win) 
 
    mouthCorner1 = center.clone() 
    mouthCorner1.move(-10, -10) 
    mouthCorner2 = mouthCorner1.clone() 
    mouthCorner2.move(20, -5) 
    mouth = Oval(mouthCorner1, mouthCorner2) 
    mouth.setFill('red') 
    mouth.draw(win) 

Finally, the list of elements for the face must be returned to the
caller::

    return [head, eye1, eye2, mouth]

Then in the main function, the program creates a face in exactly
the same place as before, but using the ``makeFace`` function, with
the original center of the face ``Point(40, 100)``. Now with the
``makeFace`` function, with its center parameter, it is also easy
to replace the old ``cir2`` with a whole face! ::

        faceList = makeFace(Point(40, 100), win) 
        faceList2 = makeFace(Point(150,125), win) 

The animation section is considerably elaborated in this version. ::

    stepsAcross = 46 
    dx = 5 
    dy = 3 
    wait = .01 
    for i in range(3): 
        moveAllOnLine(faceList, dx, 0, stepsAcross, wait) 
        moveAllOnLine(faceList, -dx, dy, stepsAcross//2, wait) 
        moveAllOnLine(faceList, -dx, -dy, stepsAcross//2, wait)

The unidentified numeric literals that were used before are
replaced by named values that easily identify the meaning of each
one. This also allows the numerical values to be stated only once,
allowing easy modification.

The whole animation is repeated three times by the use of a simple
repeat loop.

The animations in the loop body illustrate that the straight line
of motion does not need to be horizontal. The second and third
lines use a non-zero value of both dx and dy for the steps, and
move diagonally.

Make sure you see now how the whole program works together,
including all the parameters for the moves in the loop.

By the way, the documentation of the functions in a module you have
just run in the Shell is directly available. Try in the *Shell*::

    help(moveAll)

Nose in Face Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
\* Save :file:`backAndForth3.py` or :file:`backAndForth3Flush.py`
to the new name :file:`backAndForth4.py`.
Add a triangular nose in the middle of the face in the ``makeFace``
function. Like the other features of the face, make sure the
position of the nose is *relative* to the ``center`` parameter. Make
sure the nose is included in the final list of elements of the face
that get returned!

Faces Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\* Make a program ``faces.py`` that asks the user to click
the mouse, and then draws a face at the point where the user
clicked. Copy the ``makeFace`` function definition
from the previous exercise, and use it!
Elaborate this with a :ref:`Simple-Repeat-Loop`, so this is repeated six times:
After each of 6 mouse clicks, a face immediately appears at the location of the latest
click.  Think how you can reuse your code each time through the loop!

Moving Faces Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\* Animate two faces moving in different directions
*at the same time* in a program ``move2Faces.py``. You *cannot* use
the ``moveAllOnLine`` function. You will have to make a variation
of your own. You *can* use the ``moveAll`` function separately for
each face. Hint: imagine the old way of making an animated cartoon.
If each face was on a separate piece of paper, and you wanted to
animate them moving together, you would place them separately,
record one frame, move them each a bit toward each other, record
another frame, move each another bit toward each other, record
another frame, .... In our animations "record a frame" is
replaced by a short sleep to make the position visible to the user.
Make a loop to incorporate the repetition of the moves.

.. _Entry-Objects:
   
Entry Objects
-------------

Read this section if you want to allow the user to enter text
directly into a graphics window.

When using a graphics window, the shell window is still available.
Keyboard input can be done in the normal text fashion, waiting for
a response, and going on after the user presses the :kbd:`Enter` key. It
is annoying to make a user pay attention to two windows, so the
graphics module provides a way to enter text inside a graphics
window, with the ``Entry`` type. The entry is a *partial*
replacement for the ``input`` function.

Run the simple example, greet.py, which is copied below:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/greet.py

The only part of this with new ideas is::

    entry1 = Entry(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 200),10) 
    entry1.draw(win) 
    Text(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 230),'Name:').draw(win) # label for the Entry 
     
    win.getMouse()  # To know the user is finished with the text. 
    name = entry1.getText()  

The first line of this excerpt creates an Entry object, supplying
its center point and a number of characters to leave space for (10
in this case).

As with other places where input is requested, a separate static
label is added.

The way the underlying events are hidden in graphics.py, there is
no signal when the user is done entering text in an ``Entry`` box.
To signal the program, a mouse press is used above. In this case
the location of the mouse press is not relevant, but once the mouse
press is processed, execution can go on and read the Entry text.
The method name getText is the same as that used with a ``Text``
object.

Run the next example, addEntries.py, also copied below:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/addEntries.py

As with the ``input``
statement, you can only read *strings* from an ``Entry``.
With conversions, it is still possible to work with numbers.

Only one new graphical method has been included above::

    entry1.setText('0')

Again the same method name is used as with a ``Text`` object. In
this case I chose not to leave the Entry initially blank. The 0
value also reinforces that a numerical value is expected.

There is also an ``entry2`` with almost identical code. After
waiting for a mouse click, both entries are read, and the chosen
names emphasizes they are strings. The strings must be converted to
integers in order to do arithmetic and display the result.

The almost identical code for the two entries is a strong
suggestion that this code could be written more easily with a
function. You may look at the identically functioning example
program ``addEntries2.py``. The only changes are shown below. First
there is a function to create an Entry and a centered static label
over it. ::

    def makeLabeledEntry(entryCenterPt, entryWidth, initialStr, labelText, win): 
        '''Return an Entry object with specified center, width in characters, and 
        initial string value.  Also create a static label over it with 
        specified text.  Draw everything in the GraphWin win. 
        ''' 
         
        entry = Entry(entryCenterPt, entryWidth) 
        entry.setText(initialStr) 
        entry.draw(win) 
        labelCenter = entryCenterPt.clone() 
        labelCenter.move(0, 30) 
        Text(labelCenter,labelText).draw(win) 
        return entry 

In case I want to make more Entries with labels later, and refer to
this code again, I put some extra effort in, making things be
parameters even if only one value is used in this program. The
position of the label is made 30 units above the entry by using the
clone and move methods. Only the Entry is returned, on the
assumption that the label is static, and once it is drawn, I can
forget about it.  Since I do not refer later to the Text object,
I do not bother to name it, but just draw it immediately.   

Then the corresponding change in the main function is just two
calls to this function::

    entry1 = makeLabeledEntry(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 250), 25, 
                              '0', 'First Number:', win) 
    entry2 = makeLabeledEntry(Point(win.getWidth()/2, 180), 25, 
                              '0', 'Second Number:', win) 

These lines illustrate that a statement may take more than one
line. In particular, as in the Shell, Python is smart enough to
realize that there must be a continuation line if the parentheses
do not match.

While I was improving things, I also changed the conversions to
integers. In the first version I wanted to emphasize the existence
of both the string and integer data as a teaching point, but the
num1Str and num2Str variables were only used once, so a more
concise way to read and convert the values is to eliminate them::

    num1 = int(entry1.getText()) 
    num2 = int(entry2.getText()) 

.. _Color-Names:
    
Color Names
-----------

Thus far we have only used common color names. In fact there are a
very large number of allowed color names, and also the ability to draw
with custom colors.

First, the graphics package is built on an underlying graphics
system, Tkinter, which has a large number of color names defined.
Each of the names can be used by itself, like 'red', 'salmon' or
'aquamarine' or with a lower intensity by specifying with a
trailing number 2, 3, or 4, like 'red4' for a dark red.

Though the ideas for the coding have not all been introduced, it is
still informative to *run* the example program ``colors.py``. As you
click the mouse over and over, you see the names and appearances of
a wide variety of built-in color names. The names must be place in
quotes, but capitalization is ignored.

.. index::
   color_rgb
   RGB color creation - color_rgb

.. _Custom-Colors:
   
Custom Colors
-------------

Custom colors can also be created. To do that requires some
understanding of human eyes and color (and the Python tools). The
only colors detected directly by the human eyes are red, green, and
blue. Each amount is registered by a different kind of cone cell in
the retina. As far as the eye is concerned, all the other colors we
see are just combinations of these three colors. This fact is used
in color video screens: they only directly display these three
colors. A common scale to use in labeling the intensity of each of
the basic colors (red, green, blue) is from 0 to 255, with 0
meaning none of the color, and 255 being the most intense. Hence a
color can be described by a sequence of red, green, and blue
intensities (often abbreviated RGB). The graphics package has a
function, ``color_rgb``, to create colors this way. For instance a
color with about half the maximum red intensity, no green, and
maximum blue intensity would be ::

    aColor = color_rgb(128, 0, 255)

Such a creation can be used any place a color is used in the
graphics, (i.e. ``circle.setFill(aColor)``).

.. _Random-Colors:
   
Random Colors
-------------

Another interesting use of the ``color_rgb`` function is to create
random colors. Run example program ``randomCircles.py``. The code
also is here:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/randomCircles.py

*Read* the fragments of this program and their explanations:

.. index:: random.randrange

To do random things, the program needs a function from the random
module. This example shows that imported modules may be put in a
comma separated list::

    import random, time

You have already seen the built-in function ``range``. To generate
a sequence of all the integers 0, 1, ... 255, you would use ::

    range(256)

This is the full list of possible values for the red, green or blue
intensity parameter. For this program we randomly choose any *one*
element from this sequence. Instead of the ``range`` function, use
the ``random`` module's ``randrange`` function, as in ::

    r = random.randrange(256)
    b = random.randrange(256)
    g = random.randrange(256)
    color = color_rgb(r, g, b)

This gives randomly selected values to each of ``r``, ``g``, and
``b``, which are then used to create the random ``color``.

.. index::
   single: range; two parameter
   single: function; range, two parameter

I want a random circle radius, but I do not want a number as small
as 0, making it invisible. The ``range`` and ``randrange``
functions both refer to a possible sequence of values starting with
0 when a *single* parameter is used. It is also possible to add a
different starting value as the *first* parameter. You still must
specify a value *past* the end of the sequence. For instance ::

    range(3, 40)

would refer to the sequence ``3, 4, 5, ... , 39`` (starting with 3
and not quite reaching 40). Similarly ::

    random.randrange(3, 40)

randomly selects an arbitrary element of ``range(3, 40)``.

I use the two-parameter version to select random parameters for a
Circle::

    radius = random.randrange(3, 40) 
    x = random.randrange(5, 295) 
    y = random.randrange(5, 295) 
             
    circle = Circle(Point(x,y), radius) 

What are the smallest and largest values I allow for x and y? [#]_

Random values are often useful in games.

Ranges Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
Write a program ``ranges.py`` in three parts.  
(Test after each added part.)

This problem is *not a graphics program*.  
It is just a regular text program to illustrate 
your understanding of ranges and loops.

For simplicity each of the requested number sequences can just be printed with
one number per line.  Print a label for each number sequence before you print
the sequence, like ``Numbers 1-4``, ``Numbers 1-n``,
``Five random numbers in 1-n``.

#.  First *use the range function* and a for-loop to
    produce the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, and then print the numbers,
    one number per line.

#.  Prompt the
    user to input an integer n and print the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... , n -
    *including* n, using a for-loop. Hint: [#]_

#.  Use a :ref:`simple-repeat-loop` to find and print five
    randomly chosen numbers from the range 1, 2, 3, ... , n.
    Use the same value of n that the user chose earlier in the program.
    It should be possible that the number n is printed sometimes.


Text Triangle Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
\* Write a program ``texttriangle.py``.

This, too, is *not a graphics program*.  
Prompt the user for a small positive integer value, that I'll call ``n``.
Then use a *for-loop with a range function call* to make a triangular
arrangement of '#'characters, with ``n`` '#' characters in the last line.
Hint: [#]_

Then leave a blank line.  Then make a similar
triangle, except *start* with the line with ``n`` '#' characters.
To make the second triangle, you can use a for-loop of the form
discussed so far, but that is trickier than looking ahead to
:ref:`The-general-range-function`
and using a for-loop
where a range function call has a *negative* step size. 

Here is the screen after a posible run with user input 4::

    Enter a small positive integer: 4
    #
    ##
    ###
    ####

    ####
    ###
    ##
    #
    
And another possible run with user input 2::

    Enter a small positive integer: 2
    #

   Actually, lists are even trickier, because individual elements of a
   ``list`` may be *mutable*: Each mutable
   element in the cloned list is an *alias* of the corresponding element
   in the original list, so if you *mutate* its state in the cloned list,
   you also make a change to the original list.  This is distinct
   from the situation if you *replace* an
   element in the cloned list by a totally different one: then you do not
   change the original list.

   If 4 or n is the last number, what is the first number *past* the
   end of the sequence?

   A row of '#' characters is easiest if you remember the string
   multiplication operator \*.
