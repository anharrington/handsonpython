Integer Arithmetic
==================

.. index::
   single: +; addition
   single: -; subtraction

Addition and Subtraction
------------------------------------------------------

We start with the integers and integer arithmetic, not because
arithmetic is exciting, but because the symbolism should be mostly
familiar. Of course arithmetic is important in many cases, but
Python is probably more often used to manipulate text and other
sorts of data, as in the sample program in
:ref:`Running-A-Sample`.
 
Python understands numbers and standard arithmetic.
*For the whole section on integer arithmetic*, where you see a
set-off line in ``typewriter`` font, type individual lines at the
``>>>`` prompt in the Python *Shell*. Press Enter after each line
to get Python to respond::

    77 
    2 + 3 
    5 - 7 

Python should evaluate and print back the value of each expression.
Of course the first one does not require any calculation. It
appears that the shell just echoes back what you printed. 

The Python Shell is an interactive interpreter. As you can see,
after you press :kbd:`Return` (or Enter), 
it is evaluating the expression you typed
in, and then printing the result automatically. This is a very
handy environment to check out simple Python syntax and get instant
feedback. For more elaborate programs that you want to save, we
will switch to an Editor Window later.

.. index:: 
   single: *; multiplication of numbers
   single: -; negation
   multiplication; numbers
   
.. _multiplication-parentheses:
   
Multiplication, Parentheses, and Precedence
-----------------------------------------------

Try in the *Shell*::

    2 x 3

You should get your first *syntax error*. The ``x`` should have
become highlighted, indicating the location where the Python
interpreter discovered that it cannot understand you: Python does
not use ``x`` for multiplication as you may have done in grade school.
The ``x`` can be confused with the use of ``x`` as a variable (more on that
later). 

.. index:: precedence; arithmetic

Instead the symbol for multiplication is an asterisk
``*``. Enter each of the following. You may include spaces or not.
The Python interpreter can figure out what you mean either way. 
(The space can make understanding quicker for a human reader.) Try
in the *Shell*::

    2*5 
    2 + 3 * 4 

If you expected the last answer to be 20, think again: Python uses
the normal *precedence* of arithmetic operations: Multiplications
and divisions are done before addition and subtraction, unless
there are parentheses. Try ::

    (2+3)*4 
    2 * (4 - 1) 

Now try the following in the *Shell*, exactly as written, followed
by :kbd:`Enter`, with *no* closing parenthesis::

    5 * (2 + 3

Look carefully. There is no answer given at the left margin of the
next line and no prompt ``>>>`` to start a *new* expression. If you
are using Idle, the cursor has gone to the next line and has only
*indented* slightly. Python is waiting for you to finish your
expression. It is smart enough to know that opening parentheses are
always followed by the same number of closing parentheses. The
cursor is on a *continuation* line. Type just the matching
close-parenthesis and Enter, ::

    )

and you should finally see the expression evaluated. (In some
versions of the Python interpreter, the interpreter puts '...' at
the beginning of a continuation line, rather than just indenting.)

Negation also works. Try in the *Shell*::

    -(2 + 3)

.. index:: 
   division /  //  % remainder
   single: /  
   single: //
   single: %
   remainder
   
.. _Division-and-Remainders:
   
Division and Remainders
-----------------------

If you think about it, you learned several ways to do division.
Eventually you learned how to do division resulting in a decimal.
Try in the *Shell*::

    5/2 
    14/4 

As you saw in the previous section, numbers with decimal points in
them are of type float in Python. They are discussed more in
:ref:`Floats-Division-Mixed`.

In  early grade school you would likely say
"14 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 2". The problem here is
that the answer is in two parts, the integer quotient 3 and the
remainder 2, and neither of these results is the same as the
decimal result. Python has *separate* operations to generate each
part. Python uses the doubled division symbol ``//`` for the
operation that produces just the integer quotient, and introduces
the symbol ``%`` for the operation of finding the remainder. Try
each in the *Shell*::

    14/4 
    14//4 
    14%4 

Now predict and then try each of ::

    23//5 
    23%5 
    20%5 
    6//8 
    6%8 
    6/8

Finding remainders will prove more useful than you might think in
the future!

**Optional last part**: In grade school you were probably always doing such remainder calculations with positive integers, as we have above.  
However, the remainder operation is defined for all integers,
even a negative divisor.  We will *probably not need it*, but try ::

   23 % -5
   -23 % 5

In Python (but not some other programming languages), the sign of the divisor
always matched the sign of the remainder.
