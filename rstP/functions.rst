Syntax Template Typography
--------------------------

When new Python syntax is introduced, the usual approach will be to
give both specific examples and general templates. In general
templates for Python syntax the typeface indicates the the category
of each part:

===================  ===========================================  ================
Typeface             Meaning                                      Example
===================  ===========================================  ================
``Typewriter font``  Text to be written *verbatim*                ``sep=''``
*Emphasized*         A place where you can use an arbitrary       *integerValue*
                     expression. 
**Bold**             A place where you can use an arbitrary       **variableName**
                     identifier. 
Normal text          A description of what goes in that           A digit, 0-9
                     position,without giving explicit syntax
===================  ===========================================  ================

A more complete example of using this typography
with several parts would be a description of an
assignment statement:

   **variableName** ``=`` *someExpression*
   
with an arbitrary identifier, the specific symbol ``=``, and an expression.

I try to make the parts that are not verbatim to be
descriptive of the expected use.

I will use these conventions shortly in the discussion of function
syntax, and will continue to use the conventions throughout the
tutorial.

.. index:: def
   function; definition
   

.. _A-First-Function:

A First Function Definition
---------------------------

If you know it is the birthday of a friend, Emily, you might tell
those gathered with you to sing "Happy Birthday to Emily".

We can make Python display the song. *Read*, and run if you like,
the example program ``birthday1.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday1.py

You would probably not repeat the whole song to let others know
what to sing. You would give a request to sing via a descriptive
name like "Happy Birthday to Emily".

In Python we can also give a name like ``happyBirthdayEmily``, and
associate the name with whole song by using a
*function definition*. We use the Python ``def`` keyword, short for
*define*.

*Read* for now:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday2.py
   :linenos:
       
There are several parts of the syntax for a function definition to
notice:

Line 1: The *heading* contains ``def``, the name of the function,
parentheses, and finally a colon.  A more general syntax is

    ``def`` **function_name**\ ``():``

Lines 2-5: The remaining lines form the function *body* and are indented by a
consistent amount. (The exact amount is not important to the
interpreter, though 2 or 4 spaces are common conventions.)

The whole definition does just that: *defines* the meaning of the
name ``happyBirthdayEmily``, but it does not do anything else yet -
for example, the definition itself does not make anything be
printed yet. This is our first example of altering the order of
execution of statements from the normal sequential order. 

.. note::
   
   The statements in the function *definition* are *not*
   executed as Python first passes over the lines.

The code above is in example file ``birthday2.py``. Load it in Idle
and execute it from there. *Nothing* should happen visibly. This is
just like defining a variable: Python just remembers the function
definition for future reference. 

.. index:: shell; names remembered after execution

After Idle finished executing a
program, however, its version of the Shell remembers function
definitions from the program.

.. index::
   double: function; execute

In the Idle *Shell* (not the editor), enter ::

    happyBirthdayEmily

The result probably surprises you! When you give the Shell an
identifier, it tells you its *value*. Above, without parentheses,
it identifies the function code as the value (and gives a location
in memory of the code). Now try the name in the Idle Shell with
*parentheses* added::

    happyBirthdayEmily()

The parentheses tell Python to *execute* the named function rather
than just *refer* to the function. Python goes back and looks up
the definition, and only then, executes the code inside the
function definition. The term for this action is a *function call*
or function *invocation*. 

.. note:: 
   In the function *call* there is no
   ``def``, but there is the function name followed by parentheses.

     *function_name*\ ``()``

In many cases we will use a feature of program execution in Idle:
that after program execution is completed, the Idle Shell still
remembers functions defined in the program. This is not true if you
run a program by selecting it directly in the operating system.

Look at the example program ``birthday3.py``. See it just adds two
more lines, *not* indented. Can you guess what it does? Try it:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday3.py
   :linenos:

.. index::
   function; execution sequence
   execution; function;

The *execution* sequence is different from the *textual* sequence:

#. Lines 3-7: Python starts from the top, reading and remembering
   the definition. The definition ends where the indentation ends.
   (The code also shows a blank line there, but that is only for
   humans, to emphasize the end of the definition.)

#. Line 9: this is not indented inside any definition, so the
   interpreter executes it directly, calling ``happyBirthdayEmily()``
   while remembering where to return.

#. Lines 3-7: The code of the function is executed for the first
   time, printing out the song.

#. End of line 9: Back from the function call. continue on.

#. Line 10: the function is called again while this location is
   remembered.

#. Lines 3-7: The function is executed again, printing out the song
   again.

#. End of line 10: Back from the function call, but at this point
   there is nothing more in the program, and execution stops.

Functions alter execution order in several ways: by statements not
being executed as the definition is first read, and then when the
function is called during execution, jumping to the function code,
and back at the the end of the function execution.

If it also happens to be Andre's birthday, we might define a
function ``happyBirthdayAndre``, too. Think how to do that before
going on ....

.. _Multiple-Function-Definitions:

Multiple Function Definitions
-----------------------------

Here is example program ``birthday4.py`` where we add a function
``happyBirthdayAndre``, and call them both. Guess what happens, and
then try it:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday4.py

Again, everything is definitions except the last two lines. They
are the only lines executed directly. The calls to the functions
*happen* to be in the same order as their definitions, but that is
arbitrary. If the last two lines were swapped, the order of
operations would change. Do swap the last two lines so they appear
as below, and see what happens when you execute the program::

    happyBirthdayAndre() 
    happyBirthdayEmily() 

Functions that you write can also call other functions you write.
It is a good convention to have the main action of a program be in
a function for easy reference. The example program ``birthday5.py``
has the two Happy Birthday calls inside a final function, ``main``.
Do you see that this version accomplishes the same thing as the
last version? Run it. :

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday5.py
   :linenos:

If we want the program to do anything automatically when it is
runs, we need one line outside of definitions! The final line is
the only one directly executed, and it calls the code in ``main``,
which in turn calls the code in the other two functions.

Detailed order of execution:

#. Lines 3-17: Definitions are read and remembered

#. Line 19: The only statement outside definitions, is executed
   directly. This location is remembered as ``main`` is executed.

#. Line 15: Start on ``main``

#. Line 16. This location is remembered as execution jumps to
   ``happyBirthdayEmily``

#. Lines 3-7 are executed and Emily is sung to.

#. Return to the end of Line 16: Back from ``happyBirthdayEmily``
   function call

#. Line 17: Now ``happyBirthdayAndre`` is called as this location is
   remembered.

#. Lines 9-13: Sing to Andre

#. Return to the end of line 17: Back from ``happyBirthdayAndre``
   function call, done with ``main``

#. Return to the end of line 19: Back from ``main``; at the end of the
   program

There is one practical difference from the previous version. After
execution, if we want to give another round of Happy Birthday to
*both* persons, we only need to enter one further call in the
*Shell* to::

    main()

.. index:: indentation
   execution; indentation

As a simple example emphasizing the significance of a line being
indented, guess what the the example file ``order.py`` does, and
run it to check:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/order.py

Modify the file so the second print function is **out**\ dented like
below. What should happen now? Try it::

    def f(): 
        print('In function f') 
    print('When does this print?') 
    f()
    
The lines indented inside the function definition are *remembered*
first, and only executed when the function f is invoked at the end.
The lines outside any function definition (not indented) are
executed in order of appearance.

Poem Function Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a program, :file:`poem.py`, that defines a function that
prints a *short* poem or song verse. Give a meaningful name to the
function. Have the program end by calling the function three times,
so the poem or verse is repeated three times.

.. index::
   function; parameter
   parameter

.. _Function-Parameters:

Function Parameters
-------------------

As a young child, you probably heard Happy Birthday sung to a
couple of people, and then you could sing to a new person, say
Maria, without needing to hear the whole special version with
Maria's name in it word for word. You had the power of
*abstraction*. With examples like the versions for Emily and Andre,
you could figure out what change to make it so the song could be
sung to Maria!

Unfortunately, Python is not that smart. It needs explicit rules.
If you needed to explain *explicitly* to someone how Happy Birthday
worked in general, rather than just by example, you might say
something like this:

First you have to be *given* a person's name. Then you sing the
song with the person's name inserted at the end of the third line.

Python works something like that, but with its own syntax. The term
"person's name" serves as a stand-in for the actual data that
will be used, "Emily", "Andre", or "Maria". This is just like
the association with a variable name in Python. "person's name"
is not a legal Python identifier, so we will use just ``person`` as
this stand-in.

The function definition indicates that the variable name ``person``
will be used inside the function by inserting it between the
parentheses of the definition. Then in the body of the definition
of the function, person is used in place of the real data for any
specific person's name. Read and then run example program
``birthday6.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday6.py
   :linenos:

In the definition heading for ``happyBirthday``, ``person`` is
referred to as a *formal parameter*. This
variable name is a placeholder for the real name of the person
being sung to.

The last two lines of the program, again, are the only ones outside
of definitions, so they are the only ones executed directly. There
is now an actual name between the parentheses in the function
calls. The value between the parentheses here in the function call
is referred to as an *argument* or *actual parameter* of the
function call. The argument supplies the actual data to be used in
the function execution. When the call is made, Python does this by
associating the formal parameter name ``person`` with the actual
parameter data, as in an assignment statement. In the first call,
this actual data is ``'Emily'``. We say the actual parameter value
is *passed* to the function. [#param]_

The execution in greater detail:

#. Lines 3-7: Definition remembered

#. Line 9: Call to ``happyBirthday``, with actual parameter
   ``'Emily'``.

#. Line 3: ``'Emily'`` is passed to the function, so
   ``person = 'Emily'``.

#. Lines 4-7: The song is printed, with ``'Emily'`` used as the
   value of ``person`` in line 4: printing ::
       
       Happy Birthday, dear Emily.

#. End of line 9 after returning from the function call

#. Line 10: Call to ``happyBirthday``, this time with actual
   parameter ``'Andre'``

#. Line 3: ``'Andre'`` is passed to the function, so
   ``person = 'Andre'``.

#. Lines 4-7: The song is printed, with ``'Andre'`` used as the
   value of ``person`` in line 4: printing ::
       
       Happy Birthday, dear Andre.

#. End of line 10 after returning from the function call, and the program is
   over.

.. note::

    Be sure you completely understand ``birthday6.py``
    and the sequence of execution!  It illustrates extremely
    important ideas that many people miss the first time!  
    
It is
essential to understand the difference between

1. *Defining* a function (lines 3-7)
   with the ``def`` heading including *formal* parameter names,
   where the code is merely instructions to be remembered,
   not acted on immediately.

2. *Calling* a function with *actual* parameter values to be
   substituted for the formal parameters and have the function
   code actually *run* when the instruction containing the call
   is run.  Also note that the function can be
   called multiple times with different expressions as the
   actual parameters (line 9 and again in line 10).

.. index:: abstraction

The beauty of this system is that the same function definition can
be used for a call with a different actual parameter, and
then have a different effect. The value of the formal parameter ``person`` is
used in the third line of ``happyBirthday``, to put in whatever
actual parameter value was given.

.. note::

    This is the power of *abstraction*. It is one application of the
    most important principal in programming. Rather than have a number
    of separately coded parts with only slight variations, see where it
    is appropriate to combine them using a function whose parameters
    refer to the parts that are different in different situations. Then
    the code is written to be simultaneously appropriate for the
    separate specific situations, with the substitutions of the right
    parameter values.

       
You can go back to having a main function again, and everything
works. Run ``birthday7.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday7.py

In ``birthday6.py``, the function calls in lines 9 and 10 were outside
any function definition, so they did actually lead to immediate
execution of the function.  In ``birthday7.py`` the calls to happyBirthday
are inside another function definition (``main``), so they are not actually
run until the function ``main`` is run
(from the last line, outside any function).
                    

See :ref:`BirthdayFunctionEx`.

We can combine function parameters with user input, and have the
program be able to print Happy Birthday for anyone. Check out the
main method and run ``birthday_who.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/birthday_who.py
   :linenos:

This last version illustrates several important ideas:

#. There are more than one way to get information into a function:
   
   #. Have a value passed in through a parameter (from line 10 to line 3).

   #. Prompt the user, and obtain data from the keyboard (line 11).

#. It is a good idea to separate the *internal* processing of data
   from the *external* input from the user by the use of distinct
   functions. Here the user interaction is in ``main``, and the data
   is manipulated in ``happyBirthday``.

#. In the first examples of actual parameters, we used literal
   values. In general an actual parameter can be an expression. The
   expression is evaluated before it is passed in the function call.
   One of the simplest expressions is a plain variable name, which is
   evaluated by replacing it with its associated value. Since it is
   only the value of the actual parameter that is passed, not any
   variable name, there is *no need* to have a variable name used in
   an actual parameter match a formal parameter name. (Here we have the
   value of ``userName`` in ``main`` becoming the value of ``person``
   in ``happyBirthday``.)

.. index:: traceback
   error; traceback
   execution; error traceback

Now that we have nested function calls, it is worth looking further
at tracebacks from execution errors.  If I add a line to main in
``birthday7.py``::
    
    happyBirthday(2)

as in example file ``birthdayBad.py``, and then run it, you get
something close to:

  | Traceback (most recent call last):
  |   File "/hands-on/../examples/birthdayBad.py", line 15, in <module>
  |     main()
  |   File "/hands-on/../examples/birthdayBad.py", line 13, in main
  |     happyBirthday(2)
  |   File "/hands-on/../examples/birthdayBad.py", line 6, in happyBirthday
  |     print("Happy Birthday, dear " + person + ".")
  | TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly

Your file folder is probably different than /hands-on/examples.
The last three lines are most important, giving the line number
where the error was detected, the text of the line in question,
and a description of what problem was found.  Often that is all
you need to look at, but this example illustrates that
the *genesis* of the problem may be far away from the line
where the error was *detected*.  
Going further up the traceback, you find the sequence of function
calls that led to the line where the error was detected.
You can see that in ``main`` I call ``happyBirthday``
with the bad parameter, 2.

.. _BirthdayFunctionEx:

Birthday Function Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make your own further change to ``birthday7.py`` and save it as
``birthdayMany.py``: Add a function call
(but *not* another function *definition*), so Maria gets a verse, in
addition to Emily and Andre. Also print a blank line between
verses. (You may *either* do this by adding a print line to the
function definition, *or* by adding a print line between all calls to
the function.)

..  [#param]
    I have given the explicit terminology "formal parameter" and 
    "actual parameter".  In various places you may see either of these terms
    replaced by just "parameter" or maybe "argument".  In that case
    you must determine from context which is being discussed: 
    a definition and formal parameter 
    or a function call and an actual parameter.

.. index:: function; parameter

Multiple Function Parameters
----------------------------

A function can have more than one parameter in a parameter list
separated by commas. Here the example program :file:`addition5.py` changes
example program :file:`addition4a.py`, using
a function to make it easy to display many sum problems. Read and
follow the code, and then run:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/addition5.py
   :language: python3

.. index::
   parameter; actual and formal
   formal parameter
   actual parameter

The actual parameters in the function call are evaluated left to
right, and then these values are associated with the formal
parameter names in the function definition, also left to right. For
example a function call with actual parameters,
``f(actual1, actual2, actual3)``, calling a function f with
definition heading::

    def f(formal1, formal2, formal3):

acts approximately as if the first lines executed inside the called
function ``f`` were ::

    formal1 = actual1 
    formal2 = actual2 
    formal3 = actual3 

Functions provide extremely important functionality to programs,
allowing tasks to be defined once and performed repeatedly with
different data. It is essential to see the difference between the
**formal** parameters used to describe what is done inside the function
definition (like x and y in the definition of sumProblem) and the
**actual** parameters (like 2 and 3 or 1234567890123 and 535790269358)
which *substitute* for the formal parameters when the function is
actually executed. The main method above uses three different sets
of actual parameters in the three calls to sumProblem.

.. _QuotientFunctionEx:

Quotient Function Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example ``addition5.py`` is a modification of ``addition4a.py``,
putting the arithmetic problem into a function and then calling the function
several times with different parameters.
Similarly modify :file:`quotientformat.py` from
:ref:`QuotientFormatProblem` and save it
as ``quotientProb.py``.
You should create a function ``quotientProblem`` with numerical
parameters.  Like in all the earlier versions, it should print a full
sentence containing the inputs, quotient, and remainder.
The ``main`` method in the new program
should test the quotientProblem function
on several sets of literal values, and also test the function with
input from the user.

.. index:: return
   function; return
   statement; return
   sequence; function

.. _Returned-Function-Values:

Returned Function Values
------------------------

..
    :math:`$f(x)=x^{2}$`, then it follows that
    :math:`$f(3)$` is :math:`$3^{2}=9$`, and :math:`$f(3)+f(4)$` is
    :math:`$3^{2}+4^{2}=25$`


You probably have used mathematical functions in algebra class:  
They all had calculated values associated with them. For instance
if you defined 

   f(x)=x\ :sup:`2`

then it follows that f(3) is 3\ :sup:`2`, and f(3)+f(4) is
3\ :sup:`2` + 4\ :sup:`2`

Function calls in expressions get
replaced during evaluation by the value of the function.

The corresponding definition and examples in Python would be the
following, taken from example program ``return1.py``. *Read*
*and run*:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/return1.py

The new Python syntax is the *return statement*, with the word
``return`` followed by an expression. Functions that return values
can be used in expressions, just like in math class. When an
expression with a function call is evaluated, the function call is
effectively replaced temporarily by its returned value. Inside the
Python function, the value to be returned is given by the
expression in the ``return`` statement.

After the function ``f``
finishes executing from inside ::

    print(f(3))

it is as if the statement temporarily became ::

    print(9)

and similarly when executing ::

    print(f(3) + f(4)) 

the interpreter first evaluates f(3) and effectively replaces the
call by the returned result, 9, as if the statement temporarily
became ::

    print(9 + f(4))


and then the interpreter evaluates f(4) and effectively replaces
the call by the returned result, 16, as if the statement
temporarily became ::

    print(9 + 16)

resulting finally in 25 being calculated and printed.

**Python** functions can return any type of data, not just numbers, and
there can be any number of statements executed before the return
statement. Read, follow, and run the example program
``return2.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/return2.py
   :linenos:

The code above has a new feature, variables ``separator`` and
``result`` are given a value inside the function, but ``separator`` and
``result`` are *not* among the formal parameters. The assignments
work as you would expect here. More on this shortly, in
:ref:`Local-Scope`.

Details of the execution:

#. Lines 3-6: Remember the definition

#. Line 8: call the function, remembering where to return

#. Line 3: pass the parameters: ``firstName = 'Benjamin'``;
   ``lastName = 'Franklin'``

#. Line 4: Assign the variable ``separator`` the value ``', '``

#. Line 5: Assign the variable ``result`` the value of 
   ``lastName + separator + firstName`` which is  
   ``'Franklin' + ', ' + 'Benjamin'``, which evaluates to
   ``'Franklin, Benjamin'``

#. Line 6: Return ``'Franklin, Benjamin'``

#. Line 8: Use the value returned from the function call so the line
   effectively becomes  ``print('Franklin, Benjamin')``, 
   so print it.

#. Line 9: call the function with the new actual parameters,
   remembering where to return

#. Line 3: pass the parameters: ``firstName = 'Andrew'``;
   ``lastName = 'Harrington'``

#. Lines 4-6: ... calculate and return ``'Harrington, Andrew'``

#. Line 9: Use the value returned by the function and print
   ``'Harrington, Andrew'``

Compare ``return2.py`` and ``addition5.py``, from the previous
section. Both use functions. Both print, but where the printing 
*is done* differs. The function ``sumProblem`` prints directly inside
the function and returns nothing explicitly. On the other hand
``lastFirst`` does not print anything but returns a string. The
caller gets to decide what to do with the string, and above it is
printed in the main program.

.. index::
   double: None; return

Open ``addition5.py`` again, and introduce a *common mistake*.
Change the last line of the function ``main`` inserting ``print``,
so it says ::

    print(sumProblem(a, b))

Then try running the program. The desired printing is actually done
inside the function sumProblem. You introduced a statement to print
what ``sumProblem`` *returns*. Although ``sumProblem`` returns
nothing *explicitly*, Python does make every function return
something. If there is nothing explicitly returned, the special
value ``None`` is returned. You should see that in the Shell
output. This is a fairly common error.

..  warning::
    If you see a 'None' is your printed
    output where you do not expect it, it is likely that you have
    printed the return value of a function that did not return anything
    explicitly!

In general functions should do a single thing.
You can easily combine a sequence of functions, and you have more
flexibility in the combinations
if each does just one unified thing.  The function
sumProblem in :file:`addition5.py` does two things:  It creates a sentence,
and prints it.  If that is all you have, you are out of luck if you want
to do something different with the sentence string.  A better way is
to have a function that just creates the sentence, and returns it for
whatever further use you want.  Printing is one possibility, done in
:file:`addition6.py`:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/addition6.py
   :language: python3

    
.. _QuotientStringEx:
    
Quotient String Return Exercise
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create :file:`quotientReturn.py` by modifying :file:`quotientProb.py` in
:ref:`QuotientFunctionEx` so that the program accomplishes the same
thing, but everywhere change the quotientProblem function into one
called ``quotientString`` that merely *returns* the string rather
than printing the string directly. Have the ``main`` function print
the result of each call to the ``quotientString`` function.

.. index::
   function; consumer or writer

.. _Two-Roles:

Two Roles: Writer and Consumer of Functions
-------------------------------------------

The remainder of this section covers finer
points about functions that you might skip on a first reading.

We are only doing tiny examples so far to get the basic idea of
functions. In much larger programs, functions are useful to manage
complexity, splitting things up into logically related, modest
sized pieces. Programmers are both writers of functions and
consumers of the other functions called inside their functions. It
is useful to keep those two roles separate:

The user of an already written function needs to know:

#. the name of the function

#. the order and meaning of parameters

#. what is returned or produced by the function


*How* this is accomplished is not relevant at this point. For
instance, you use the work of the Python development team, calling
functions that are built into the language. You need know the three
facts about the functions you call. You do not need to know exactly
*how* the function accomplishes its purpose.

On the other hand when you *write* a function you need to figure
out exactly how to accomplish your goal, name relevant variables,
and write your code, which brings us to the next section.

.. index::
   double: local; scope

.. _Local-Scope:

Local Scope
-----------

For the logic of writing functions, it is important that the writer
of a function knows the names of variables inside the function. On
the other hand, if you are only using a function, maybe written by
someone unknown to you, you should not care what names are given to
values used internally in the implementation of the function you
are calling. Python enforces this idea with *local scope* rules:
Variable names initialized and used inside one function are
*invisible* to other functions. Such variables are called *local*
variables. For example, an elaboration of the earlier program
``return2.py`` might have its ``lastFirst`` function with its local
variable ``separator``, but it might also have another function
that defines a ``separator`` variable, maybe with a different value
like ``'\n'``. They would not conflict. They would be 
independent. This avoids lots of errors!

For example, the following code in the example program
``badScope.py`` causes an execution error. Read it and run it, and
see:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/badScope.py

We will fix this error below. The execution error message mentions
"global name". Names defined outside any function definition, at
the "top-level" of your program are called *global*. They are a
special case. They are discussed more in the next section.

If you do want local data from one function to go to another,
define the called function so it includes parameters! Read and
compare and try the program ``goodScope.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/goodScope.py

With parameter passing, the parameter name ``x`` in the function
``f`` does not need to match the name of the actual parameter in
``main``. The definition of ``f`` could just as well have been::

    def f(whatever): 
        print(whatever) 

.. index::
   global constant
   constant
   scope; global

Global Constants
----------------

If you define *global variables* (variables defined outside of any function
definition), they are visible inside all of your functions. 
They have *global scope*.  It is
good programming practice to avoid defining global variables and
instead to put your variables inside functions and explicitly pass
them as parameters where needed. One common exception is constants:
A *constant* is a name that you give a fixed data value to, by
assigning a value to the name only in a single assignment
statement. You can then use the name of the fixed data value in
expressions later. A simple example program is ``constant.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/constant.py

This example uses numbers with decimal points, discussed more in
:ref:`Floats`. By convention, names for
constants are all capital letters.

Issues with global variables do not come up if they are only used
as constants.

Function names defined at the top-level also have global scope.
This is what allows you to use one function you defined inside
another function you define, like calling ``circleArea`` from inside ``main``.
