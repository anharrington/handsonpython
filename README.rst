This is intended as about half of a CS0 course introducing ideas in Python.

It is intended as a very gentle introduction, just using the standard
Python distribution with its Idle IDE, and this tutorial with its examples folder.

A full CS1, major introduction through Python, is at https://runestone.academy.
